## TODOS
- Maybe also have a `profile.zsh`  file?
- `gclear`
- `ppurge`
- cleanup `clean-shell`
- autocompletion and ZLE
- `setopt HIST_LEX_WORDS`
- `add-named-dir trash $SampShell_TRASHDIR` when trashdir doesnt exist doesnt great

## TODO: Maybe also have a `.zprofile`?

# TODO: can you autoload multiple times? if so stick this in individual files, eg macos.zsh
