# Basic SampShell definitions for _all_ interactive POSIX-complaint shells.
#
# It's expected that this file will be `.`'d at the start of a shell instance,
# but it is possible that might be `.`'d later (such as if `source`da
# It's expected that this file can be `.`'d at any point, so only the bare-
# minimum setup is done. This also means that all declarations start with the
# prefix `SampShell_` so as to not conflict with any extant identifiers.
#
# The file also accepts a single argument, which will be used as the value
# for `SampShell_ROOTDIR`; if an argument isn't given, `SampShell_ROOTDIR` is
# left empty.
