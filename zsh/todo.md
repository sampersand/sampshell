4.3.3: Prefix (digit) arguments

^ means ctrl, ^[ means escape
`^W` deletes a word to the left
`^[xu` undoes
up arrow a bunch, then `^o` executes that, then asks if you want to execute the nextline
# TODO: history, and see if you can just press a key to get the omst recent one
hitting `^r` multiple times lets you go back further, woah
