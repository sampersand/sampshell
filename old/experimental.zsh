## STUFF that was experimental, but ive decided against

# I never go beyond like 5 lol:
DIRSTACKSIZE=30   # I just started using dirstack more, if it ever grows unwieldy I can set this.

# setopt RM_STAR_WAIT       # Disabled, since I don't need this level of protection. Wait 10 seconds before accepting the `y` in `rm *`
# setopt NO_FLOW_CONTROL    # Modern terminals dont need control flow lol (?? whats this even do?)
# WORDCHARS=$WORDCHARS # ooo, you can modify which chars are for a word in ZLE
# CORRECT_IGNORE_FILE ; setopt correct_all
